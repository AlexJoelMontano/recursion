# recursion
There are 2 files:
    -fibonacci.rb
    -merge_sort.rb

fibonacci.rb will prompt a user for how many iterations of the fibonacci sequence they want to display. 

merge_sort.rb will prompt the user for how many numbers they want to enter. 
    Then it will prompt for each subsequent number prompted amount of times. 
    The program will display how its performing merge sort to sort the numbers 
    It will then display the end results of an array of numbers properly sorted. 

This is a project for The Odin Project - Recursion.
